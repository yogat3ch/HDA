Description: From simply finding missing values and computing their proportion in a data set
    to algorithically determining mathematical relationships between predictors and response variables for regression,
    this package provide functions for some of the most common tasks involved in analyses of health data. The current
    version provides functions, in addition to those list above, that will:
    1) Unload packages given a character vector of package names, or unload all packages
    2) Report p-values and a number of statistical test outputs in APA formatting (suitable for inline discussion of results) in HTML & LaTeX formats
    3) True function for finding the mode, perform assumption evaluation for statistical tests including a visual examination of variable distributions with normality tests, and homogeneity of variance.
    4) A dark blue theme for ggplot2.
